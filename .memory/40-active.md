# Active State: Evolution Engine

- **Visual Replication (Shutterstock)**: Neon waveforms, infinite tunnels, and cyber disco balls are live and orchestrated.
- **Architectural Lighting**: `RectAreaStrips` provide sharp light pillars and reflections.
- **Structural Overlays**: Technical grids and pulsing wireframe bounding boxes are integrated.
- **Technical HUD**: Real-time monospace data readout is active.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented **Shutterstock-inspired** visual motifs (Waveforms, Tunnels, Disco Ball).
- Exposed **Spectral Frequency Data** in the audio engine for detailed waveforms.
- Updated `Director` with new chapters: `WAVEFORM_INFRA`, `NEON_TUNNEL`, `DISCO_CYBER`.
- Verified production build stability.

- Replaced multiple static scenes (`GridScene`, `StarfieldScene`) with a single `GenerativeScene`.
- Integrated `Zustand` for performant global state management.
- Added `maath` for liquid-smooth parametric transitions.
- Implemented **Track Temperature** logic for smooth energy transitions.
- Created **OrganicScene** with custom GLSL shaders.
- Implemented **CinematicCamera** with `maath` damping.

## Priorities

- **Refinement**: Fine-tune the "Kick" detection threshold for different musical genres.
- **Expansion**: Add more geometric primitives (Torus, Knot) to the morphing logic.
- **Aesthetics**: Explore more complex noise-based deformations in the fragment shader.
