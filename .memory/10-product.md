## User Personas

- **The DJ/VJ**: Needs a high-impact visual backdrop that doesn't requires manual control during a performance.
- **The Audience**: Seeks immersive, rhythmic visuals that mirror the energy and structure of the music.

## User Journeys

1. **Launch**: User opens the app, sees the branding, and clicks "Launch".
2. **Audio Setup**: App requests mic access; user starts playing music.
3. **Engagement**: Engine begins tracking beats. Every 16 beats, the scene morphs.
4. **Progression**: Over 15-30 minutes, the visual palette and geometry complexity increase, tracking the set's energy.
5. **Full Immersion**: User double-clicks for fullscreen; cursor hides; only the generative art remains.

## Key Metrics

- **Beat Sync Accuracy**: How well visual pulses match audio kicks.
- **Frame Continuity**: Absence of stutters during complex morphing.
- **Visual Variety**: Perceived change in "mood" every phrase.
